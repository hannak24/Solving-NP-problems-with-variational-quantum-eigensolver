# Solving the partitioning problem with variational quantum eigensolver
In this project I used or implemented the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on several quantum design platforms and tested it on a reduction of an NP-Complete problem (the partitioning problem) to Ising Hamiltonian eigenvalue search. In the summary I present the mathematical background of the project, a comparison of the results from the different platforms and future work suggestions.
